# Pion-Photo-Production
Neutral Pion production for use with nucdens python package https://pypi.org/project/nucdens/

Currently the code only works for the one body case.

Initial implimentation based off of this paper
Lenkewitz 2011: Neutral pion photoproduction off 3H and 3He in chiral perturbation theory
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3400

With use of the density formalism as described in this paper.
